# Portfolio

Hi, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Catherine Guo and I'm currently a senior at Northwestern studying Computer Science. This portfolio reflects some of my past and current projects that I've had a lot of fun creating. I chose these projects since they reflect some the languages I am most proficent, and they are the most visually appealing and user interactive.

If you would like to watch the robots evolve in my Artifical Life Project, there is a youtube video in the corresponding README. 


If you would like to experiment with the Particle Swarms and Parametric Generators there is an external link in each branch that will bring you to your own simulation in Glitch!



In this Portfolio there are 6 branches for these three projects:
## Artificial Life Project:
  3 branches - overview of the creation process for this project, the data I used to train the robots, and the code and process for the evolution of these robots
## Particle Swarms project:
  1 branch containing the code and description, plus gifs of the me interacting with the project to watch
## Parametric Generators project
  1 branch containing the code and description, plus gifs of the me interacting with the project to watch

In the README of each branch there is a description of the project and how it works, enjoy!
