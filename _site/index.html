        <h2 class="project_titles">Artificial Life Project</h2>
        <p>This project investigates how body size and mutation affect the performance of robotic creatures designed to march to a beat. Conducting three experiments with varying restrictions on body structure while maintaining a constant population size, my study examines the impact of these factors on movement and fitness over generations.</p>
