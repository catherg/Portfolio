        </h3>
        <p>The best performing body and brain is saved in this repository as experiment1_body(givenID).urdf, experiment1_brain(givenID).nndf, etc.</p>
        <p>If needed, run the best performing body in each experiment using these files (delete the "experiment1_" tag in the name before you run it) - These files can be run in solution and parallelhillclimber, specifically in line 16 of of parallelHillClimber.py, change the self.nextAvailableID to the ID number given in these files and change self.parents[i] to self.parents[0]. - Then in line 67 of of parallelHillClimber.py put self.parents[0] instead of self.parents[highest]</p>
        <p>Note about running the program: If there are issues with the fitness value being read, run it again and it should be read fine (this error occurs sometimes when running a large number of generations)</p>

                <br>
                <p>The task of the creature is to march to the beat, meaning that they will be walking with small wiggles and jumps in between steps. As the generations continue, the creature will randomly mutate by adding random cube to any axis, and the brain then adding a sensor neuron.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    I will be conducting three experiments and determining under which experiment the creature performs the best in. The first experiment contains a population size of 10 and a total of 300 generations, in the first experiment the creature cannot spawn more than 15 cubes. The second experiment contains a population size of 10 and a total of 150 generations, and in this experiment the creature cannot spawn more than 20 cubes. The last experiment contains a population size of 10 over 100 generations, and in this experiment the creature can spawn as many cubes as it is able to.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    After calculating the time it takes to produce one simulation(~30 seconds), it wasn't plausible for me to produce 50,000 simulations, so instead of doing a total of 500 generations over 10 seeds I made the constant of each experiment time. After experimenting with the time needed to run each simulation for the different experiments, I chose to have each experiment take 8 hours to run. Another constant in these experiments is the population size, which always stays at 10. Since I will only be doing three experiments I used 3 seeds, one for each experiment.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    I tested these experiments by making the body mutate (look at "Body and Brain Mutation" Section, line 75) randomly every generation. The control experiment in this case was experiment 1, which restricted the robot to have 15 joints. I did this by inserting this piece of code:
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="joints.png" alt="code describing joint limit" width="250px">
                </div>
                <p>
                    These two lines made it so that if the robot was at the largest size possible, it would completely skip over the mutation of the body and not change anything. I made this into my control experiment because I isolated the variable of interest which was the number of cubes.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this experiment came from a question I had about how robots of different sizes could complete certain tasks, and what the optimal size and mutation for the body would be to complete a simple task like walking or "marching to the beat".
