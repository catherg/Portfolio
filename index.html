        Hi, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Catherine Guo and I'm currently a senior at Northwestern studying Computer Science. This portfolio reflects some of my past projects that I've had a lot of fun creating. I chose these projects since they reflect the languages I am most proficent in, and they are the most visually appealing and user interactive.

    <section>
        <h2 class="project_titles">Artificial Life Project</h2><br>
        <p>This project investigates how body size and mutation affect the performance of robotic creatures designed to march to a beat. Conducting three experiments with varying restrictions on body structure while maintaining a constant population size, my study examines the impact of these factors on movement and fitness over generations.</p>

        <h2>Particle Swarms Project</h2><br>
        <p>Explore this project's dynamics through interactive simulations and GIFs demonstrating interaction with the system.  A link to your own simulation experience on Glitch is available in the project's branch.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Parametric Generators Project</h2><br>
        <p>This project features code, descriptions, and displays of each generator.  You can experiment with the parametric generators via an external link in the project's branch.</p>
