# Portfolio

Hi, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Catherine and I'm currently a junior at Northwestern in the McCormick School of Engineering studying Computer Science. This portfolio reflects some of my past and current interests, and projects I had a lot of fun creating.

This portfolio contains 3 of the projects I thought were the most fun to create.

In this Portfolio there are 3 main branches for these three projects. There's an Artifical Life branch, a Particle Swarms branch, and a Parametric Generators branch.

In the README of each branch there is a description of the project and my creation process, enjoy!
