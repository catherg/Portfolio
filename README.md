# Portfolio

Hi, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Catherine and I'm currently a junior at Northwestern studying Computer Science. This portfolio contains 3 of the projects I thought were the most fun to create.

In this Portfolio there are 3 branches, an Artifical Life branch, a Particle Swarms branch, and a Parametric Generators branch.
