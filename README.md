## Particle Swarms
## First System

My first system was the Pastel System, and it uses an attraction force. An emergent behavior this system had was how separated the particles would become and how quickly they would become separated. I changed the coloring, speed, shape, and mouse control of these particles.

## Second system

My second system is the Spring System, and it uses wander forces. I changed the rate the particles cluster in this system, the speed they move, and how they move. I also changed background colors, shapes, and added more vertices as shapes into the particles. An emergent behavior from this system was how much of the particle speed tended to stay the same despite the changes I made to different aspects of the system.

## Third system

My third system was the Monkey System, and this uses local-frame physics. It's emergent behavior was how easily the particles end up spinning based only off of the arrow controls in the code. I changed a lot of the visuals in this system from the example given, changing the coloring of everything, adding animals, and changing the shapes of the trails and the trails themselves. I changed the speed of the trails and made them faster, and made the trail path change in color. I also changed the direction of the particles, making more of them spin and go all over the place so that the system looked more chaotic.


## Fourth system
My fourth was the Bird System and this system used attraction forces and particle-to-all-particles" forces. It's emergent behavior to me was how tightly the could particles stay clustered together over a time constraint and even with adjusting the controls. I made this system resemble confusing birds flying in the sky in flocks. I changed the number of particles, changed the visuals of the original system, adding birds and taking away the arrow and circle indicating where the birds were flocking and the direction. I also changed the speed they would flock and how they would cluster.
