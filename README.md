# Portfolio

Hi, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Catherine Guo and I'm currently a junior at Northwestern in the McCormick School of Engineering studying Computer Science. This portfolio reflects some of my past and current interests, and projects I had a lot of fun creating. I chose these projects since these reflect the languages I am most proficent in (Python and JavaScript), and they are the most visually appealing and user interactive. If you would like to watch the robots evolve in my Artifical Life Project, there is a youtube video in the corresponding README, and if you would like to experiment with the Particle Swarms and Parametric Generators there is an external link in each branch that will bring you to your own simulation in Glitch!

Here are some previews of the projects:

In this Portfolio there are 6 branches for these three projects. There are 3 branches for the Artifical Life project where you can find an overview of the creation process for this project, the data I used to train the robots, and the code and process for the evolution of these robots. There is one branch containing the code and description for my Particle Swarms project, and one branch for my Parametric Generators project.

In the README of each branch there is a description of the project and how it works, enjoy!
